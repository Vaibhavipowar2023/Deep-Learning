# Deep Learning Concepts Tutorial

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive tutorial on the foundational concepts of deep learning. It covers various techniques and architectures, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transfer learning. The goal is to help beginners understand the core principles of deep learning and how to implement basic models using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch

## Introduction to Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn from large amounts of data. It enables computers to perform tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. This tutorial provides an in-depth look at the core concepts and how to implement them using modern deep learning frameworks.

## Prerequisites

## Essential deep learning concepts:

**Artificial Neurons and Perceptrons:** The basic building blocks of neural networks.

**Activation Functions:** Functions that introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh).

**Loss Functions:** Measure the difference between predicted and actual outputs (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy).

**Optimization Algorithms:** Techniques used to minimize loss (e.g., SGD, Adam).

**Backpropagation:** The algorithm used to update weights through gradient descent.

### Neural Network Architectures

**Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) :** A basic neural network where information moves in one direction, from input to output. Used for simple classification and regression tasks.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) :** Specialized for processing grid-like data (e.g., images). It uses convolutional layers to detect patterns and features in the data.

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) :** Suitable for sequential data, such as time series or text. RNNs can remember past inputs and use them to make predictions.

## Transfer Learning
A technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task, allowing for quicker training with less data.

## Training and Evaluation
This section explains the process of training a model, evaluating its performance, and tuning hyperparameters. Key topics include:

**Train/Test Split:** How to split the dataset for training and evaluation.

**Metrics:** Common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Overfitting and Underfitting:** Techniques for avoiding these issues, such as regularization and dropout.
