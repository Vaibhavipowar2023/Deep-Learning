1. Batch Gradient Descent :Gradient descent allows you to find weights (w1,w2,w3) and bias in following linear equation for housing price prediction
2. Stochastic Gradient descent:Stochastic GD will use randomly picked single training sample to calculate error and using this error we backprpage to adjust weight
3. Min Batch GD :we use a batch of m samples where 0 < m < n (where n is total number of training samples)
